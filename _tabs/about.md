Hey! I am a former computer science student from Germany. Since I was at university I dreamed of getting a job in the cyber security industry. However getting a foothold isn't that easy if you don't have explicit experiences on that field. In 2022, I decided to start this blog along with increasing my knowledge about cyber security.

I will covering the basics as well as current threats, walkthroughs from *Hack The Box* or bug bounty hunting. My goal is to create a good starting point for beginners and interested persons. 

You can find me on Twitter and [Mastordon](https://mastodon.social/@WITSec). Cheers!
